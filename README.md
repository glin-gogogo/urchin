# Urchin

Urchin is a multi-tenant system with the following functions:
1. A unified software-defined storage network that can connect heterogeneous storage systems. 
2. Datasets can be viewed uniformly across the entire network.
3. Datasets can be scheduled uniformly between different data centers. 
4. It can realize typical data scheduling functions in intelligent computing networks such as "computing follows data" and "data follows computing". 

"Computing follows data" means that computing tasks can migrate and execute according to the location of data.  "Data follows computing" means that data can migrate according to the needs of computing tasks.

In short, Urchin is a software-defined storage and data management system that can unify data views and scheduling between heterogeneous storage system, and realize the collaborative migration of computing and data.
